## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 - "Foundation"

This is the inaugural release of CX Framework, marking the first stable version suitable for production use. The framework provides a solid foundation for cross-platform GUI development in Rust with:

**🎯 Production Ready**: Zero-warning compilation, comprehensive testing, and thorough documentation ensure reliability for real-world applications.

**⚡ High Performance**: Direct platform API integration delivers native performance with minimal overhead across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

**🛡️ Memory Safe**: Built on Rust's ownership system, CX Framework eliminates entire classes of memory-related bugs common in GUI frameworks.

**🎨 Developer Friendly**: Intuitive builder patterns, comprehensive error handling, and rich documentation make development productive and enjoyable.

**🔧 Extensible Architecture**: Modular design with clear abstractions allows easy customization and extension for specific use cases.

This release establishes CX Framework as a compelling alternative to existing GUI solutions, combining the performance of native development with the safety and productivity of Rust.

### Upgrade Guide

Since this is the initial release, no upgrade considerations are necessary. Future releases will include detailed upgrade guides for breaking changes.

### Known Issues

- Custom drawing performance could be optimized further on Linux
- Some advanced layout scenarios may need additional constraint options
- Documentation examples assume basic Rust knowledge
